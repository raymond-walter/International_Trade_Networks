# International_Trade_Networks

Master's Level Project from graduate Econometrics II, University of Arkansas, conducted March 2012 â€“ May 2012.
Principally used Stata, Excel, and MATLAB.
 
The project calculated random walk betweenness centrality (RWBC) on 
directed weighted trade network (53 countries over 20 years) 
built from NBER-UN Trade Data.

Fixed effect regression of country trade
volume on RWBC found significant effect: 
smaller volumes are more sensitive to changes on the network.
